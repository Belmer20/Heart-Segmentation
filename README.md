# Heart Segmentation Project

## Overview
The **Heart Segmentation Project** aims to accurately segment the heart from medical images using advanced deep learning techniques. 

## Key Features
- **Deep Learning Model**: Utilizes a U-Net architecture optimized for medical image segmentation.
- **MONAI Integration**: Leverages MONAI (Medical Open Network for AI) for its specialized tools in medical imaging.
- **High-Quality Data Processing**: Works with NIfTI (Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative) format files for reliable data handling.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Includes comprehensive training and testing scripts for reproducibility and evaluation.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Frameworks**: PyTorch, MONAI
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Data Format**: NIfTI files (.nii, .nii.gz)



## Preparation
 Before dealing with the images , we sliced them using the 3D Slicer tool that slices every nifti image into dicoms.
